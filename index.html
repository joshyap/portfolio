            <h1>about me</h1>
            <div>
                <p>My name is Josh and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I became interested in web and software development when I had an idea for a business, but couldn't stand the idea of letting someone else build it. Even though that business is a highlight of my life, my biggest takeaway was finding my passion for code.</p>
                <p>I have since worked at various startups and companies in increasingly technical roles. Although most of my formal experience is in data engineering and support engineering, working on the frontend is what I enjoy the most. I thrive on the quick and tangible feedback that comes along with frontend work. Also, I love knowing my work will be felt by end users directly.</p>
                <p>Beyond code, I am very interested in personal finance. I have recently launched a blog at <a href="https://www.get-fired.com/" class="linkSize">get-fired.com</a> that I am using to document my journey to financial independence. I love learning and talking about personal finance because I think people can do their best work when they can have the right motivations behind their efforts. I will be launching an accompanying youtube channel sometime in the near future.</p>
                <p>When I break away from the screens though, I love playing basketball and tennis, cycling, hiking, and traveling. I also tend to enjoy the finer things in life, like miniature tabletop wargaming, euro boardgames, vintage video games, and cryptocurrencies.</p>

                    <p>This twitter bot tweets out a daily quote from a list that I curated over the years. It was built in python using the tweepy library. Instead of a cronjob, there is an AWS CloudWatch trigger that runs every 4 hours. This was set up using AWS free tier account constraints and was a fun little developer project.</p>

                <p>Some coworkers and I came up with a slack channel in which we have to follow a special rule for messaging. For every letter in a word, every vowel is replaced with an "o" and every "o" is replaced with "oo". It is written in javascript, users a bit of bootstrap for styling, and utilizes the Speech Synthesis Web API to read converted text in a variety of voices, accents, pitches, and languages.</p>

                <p>In order to send responsive emails out for a project that had a particularly varied user base, I had to look into how to make responsive emails to handle different email clients. This demo email was made using the <a href="https://mjml.io/">MJML</a> framework and was a very pleasant experience, especially compared to hand coding every detail of the email layouts.</p>
